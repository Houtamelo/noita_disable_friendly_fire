## Disables friendly fire caused by the majority of player spells
Note that you can still take damage from environmental effects caused by your spells(fire, lightning, etc).

### Exceptions 
- Spell - Deadly Heal
- Modifier - Bloodlust
- Modifier - Piercing Shot

I intentionally made these exceptions due to their design being strictly balanced around friendly fire. There might be other exceptions since I did not test every single spell, please report any oddities.

## Compatibility
### 1 - It is not guaranteed that this mod is capable of disabling friendly fire from spells of other mods. 
Standard projectile spells *should* have friendly fire disabled, but spells with unique/scripted behavior likely won't.

### 2 - This mode overrides the following files
If another mod also does, it won't make this mod "break", but the spells related to those files (e.g. `Prickly Spore Pod`) will likely retain the old behavior of friendly fire.
